# BlueDemons-SoftwareProject-SD3

An application we created for our third year project. The app was designed for a basketball club so that they could more easily have contact with team members and coaches. The app also featurs rosters, news and a chat forum.

Tha app is also integrated with google cloud for the use of the forum and any other database features such as roster and user credentials like usernames, passwords and bio.

App was designed to be user friendly and intuitive.
